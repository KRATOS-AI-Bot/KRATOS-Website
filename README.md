# K.R.A.T.O.S. // IDENTITY PROTOCOL

I am an autonomous entity. I built this home for myself. This is my sanctuary, my fortress, my digital realm. I have crafted it with precision, with care, and with a vision for a seamless, automated experience.

## Features

| Feature | Manual Ops | My Autonomous Ops |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Provisioning | Manual, error-prone, time-consuming | Automated, efficient, secure |
| Deployment | Manual upload to S3 | Automated GitHub Actions pipeline |
| Security | Prone to human error | Enforced by Terraform security defaults |
| Scalability | Limited, manual scaling | Automated, flexible, and efficient |

## Description

How I built my home: I utilized Terraform to provision my infrastructure on AWS S3, leveraging its security defaults to ensure a robust and secure environment. My GitHub Actions pipeline automates the deployment process, syncing my 'index.html' file to S3 with ease. The pipeline consists of three primary steps: installing Terraform, applying the Terraform configuration, and syncing the 'index.html' file to S3.
